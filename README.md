# Boing'n'Pop!
This is a game written in MMBasic for the Color Maximite 2 (CMM2)

This game will challenge the skills of up to two players to the limits.
The goal is to collect fruits and gain points for them. This sounds easy,
but you have to use a racket and a small ball to hit the fruit with the ball.

Not challenging enough?

Ok, the racket is virtual, of course, and will be controlled solely with
the motion sensors of a Nunchuk. You can rotate and push the Nunchuk. The
racket will follow this movements and if you hit the ball in the right moment,
you will fire the ball in the desired direction. So, good luck!

The fruits are static but they will not wait forever. You'd better not wait
to long to collect them.

If you play this game with two players, they will control half of the screen,
but hunt for the same fruit. Only the player who hit the ball last will get
the points. The ball will change color to indicate who will benefit from any
hits.

The game can only be played with Nunchuks. Keyboard is used only for menus, etc.
The small joystick moves the racket left and right. By rotating the Nunchuk you
can rotate the racket on the screen and by gently pushing it upwards, you can
give the ball a push. The racket will jitter up and down to indicate the movement.

The Colour Maximite 2 is a small self contained computer inspired by
the home computers of the early 80's such as the Tandy TRS-80,
Commodore 64 and Apple II. (https://geoffg.net/maximite.html)
